# DDS
100MHz DDS Signal Source

This signal source is based on the AD9913 DDS Chip and will interface to a STM32F4 Microcontroller. Output power and frequency are set using a rotary encoder with a push button. 

Design Goals:
Pout Max: +20dBm
Dynamic Range: 50dB
SFDR: 70dBc
Frequency Range: 10kHz - 100MHz

User Interface:
LCD
Rotary Encoder

Features:
1dB incremental adjustments
Variable frequency step size
Coax output
